Overview;Assumptions;Model assumptions;"Bats occur within their bioregions where they occur, and around their highest density of occurrence points (MSDMs)
Bat distribution is driven bioclimatic covariates, karst and native forest cover. Accessibility bias partially drives observed occurrences. Sampling bias is minimized by filtering, spatial thinning and minimal occurrences for inclusion criteria (N=40)."
